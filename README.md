# Advent of Code 2025

This repo has my attempts to complete the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.
I'm challenging myself to work through the programming logic without any AI to try to maintain and improve my ability to think.
I did use AI to write the mix tasks to make it easier to run the scripts for each day, since I'd never done that before.

I've included my inputs in the repo, so hopefully I'm not giving away any secrets.

## Installation

You can run the scripts for each day with mix tasks, for example:

```sh
  mix day02
```
