# Advent of Code 2025

This repo has my attempts to complete the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.
I'm challenging myself to work through the programming logic without any AI to try to maintain and improve my ability to think.

I've included my inputs in the repo, so hopefully I'm not giving away any secrets.

## AI Use
I used AI to write the mix tasks to make it easier to run the scripts for each day, since I'd never done that before.
And in the spirit of full confession, I had AI re-arrange some of the code for me to be more Elixir-like.
I'm still learning how to organize an Elixir project (especially a non-Phoenix project), so I felt okay about that.
The code, though, is all me.


## Installation

You can run the scripts for each day with mix tasks, for example:

```sh
  mix day02
```
